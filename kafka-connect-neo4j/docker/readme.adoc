==== Configuring the stack

Start the compose file

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

You can access your Neo4j instance under: http://localhost:7474, log in with `neo4j` as username and `connect` as password (see the docker-compose file to change it).

===== Plugin installation

You can choose your preferred way in order to install the plugin:

* *Build it locally*
+
--
Build the project by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

Create a directory `plugins` at the same level of the compose file and unzip the file `neo4j-kafka-connect-neo4j-<VERSION>.zip` inside it.
--

* *Download the zip from the Confluent Hub*

+
--
Please go to the Confluent Hub page of the plugin:

https://www.confluent.io/connector/kafka-connect-neo4j-sink/

And click to the **Download Connector** button.

Create a directory `plugins` at the same level of the compose file and unzip the file `neo4j-kafka-connect-neo4j-<VERSION>.zip` inside it.
--

* *Download and install the plugin via Confluent Hub client*
+
--
If you are using the provided compose file you can easily install the plugin by using the Confluent Hub.

Once the compose file is up and running you can install the plugin by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it connect confluent-hub install neo4j/kafka-connect-neo4j:<version>
----

When the installation will ask:

[source,bash]
----
The component can be installed in any of the following Confluent Platform installations:
----

Please prefer the solution `(where this tool is installed)` and then go ahead with the default options.

At the end of the process the plugin is automatically installed.

==== Multi Database Support

Neo4j 4.0 Enterprise has https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.0/manage-databases/[multi-tenancy support],
in order to support this feature you can define into the json (or via the Confluent UI)
a param named `neo4j.database` which is the targeted database name.

*N.b.* If no value is specified the connector will use the Neo4j's default db.

==== Create the Sink Instance

To create the Sink instance and configure your preferred ingestion strategy, you can follow instructions described
into <<kafka-connect-sink-instance, Create the Sink Instance>> and <<kafka-connect-sink-strategies, Sink Ingestion Strategies>>
sections.

==== Create the Source Instance

To create the Sink instance and configure your preferred ingestion strategy, you can follow instructions described
into <<kafka-connect-source-instance, Create the Source Instance>> section.

===== Use the Kafka Connect Datagen

In order to generate a sample dataset you can use Kafka Connect Datagen as explained in <<examples, `Example with Kafka Connect Datagen`>> section.

[NOTE]
Before start using the data generator please create indexes in Neo4j (in order to speed-up the import process)
