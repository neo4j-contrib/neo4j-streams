This chapter provides an introduction to the Neo4j Streams Library and Kafka Connect Neo4j Connector.

Many user and customers want to integrate Kafka and other streaming solutions with Neo4j.
Either to ingest data into the graph from other sources.
Or to send update events (change data capture - CDC) to the event log for later consumption.

This extension was developed to satisfy all these use-cases and more to come.

Neo4j Streams can run in two modes:

* as a Neo4j plugin:

** **Neo4j Streams Source**: a transaction event handler events that sends data to a Kafka topic
** **Neo4j Streams Sink**: a Neo4j application that ingest data from Kafka topics into Neo4j via templated Cypher Statements
** **Neo4j Streams Procedures**: two procedures `streams.publish`, which allows custom message streaming from Neo4j to the configured environment, and `streams.consume` which allows to consume messages from a given topic.
* as a **Kafka-Connect Plugin**: a plugin for the Confluent Platform that allows to ingest data into Neo4j, from Kafka topics, via Cypher queries. At the moment it
offers only the Sink functionality.

Experienced Neo4j users will likely prefer running the software as a Neo4j Plugin.  Kafka administrators
may prefer using the Kafka Connect method.

[NOTE]
**Be aware of not configuring both Neo4j plugin and Kafka Connect worker. They will generate errors if used simultaneously, so
just one at a time has to be used.**

// [[kafka_connect_neo4j_connector_overview]]
== Kafka Connect Neo4j Connector

As a **Kafka Connect Neo4j Connector**, neo4j-streams is deployed separately from the Neo4j database.  At this time,
the connect worker can be used to push data to Neo4j (Neo4j as the consumer) but does not yet support
change data capture (CDC) coming _from_ Neo4j.

// [[neo4j_streams_plugin_overview]]
== Neo4j Streams Plugin

As a **Neo4j plugin**, neo4j-streams runs inside of the database, and can both consume and produce messages
to Kafka.

== Compatibility between Neo4j and Neo4j Streams

Following a compatibility table between Neo4j and Neo4j Streams database plugin.  If you are using the Kafka Connect Neo4j connector, we recommend the latest version to be compatible with all versions of Neo4j.
