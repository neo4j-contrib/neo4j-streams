== Architectural Guidance

The purpose of this section is to:

* Describe how this integration works
* Discuss the architectural issues that are at play
* Provide a basis for advice on how to build systems with Neo4j & Kafka

[NOTE]
Customers should use the information in this document to design the best possible pipelines to connect graphs and streams.

== The Challenge:  Graph ETL

Data coming from Kafka isn't a graph.  When we load JSON documents or Avro into a Graph, what we're actually doing is extracting relevant bits of data from some input message.  We're then transforming those relevant bits into a "Graph Snippet" and then loading it into Neo4j.

Using neo4j-streams is a form of graph ETL.   And it pays to separate out these two pieces (the extraction and the transformation) and handle them separately if we want to do this in a performant and easy to maintain manner.   If we are producing records from Neo4j back out to Kafka, it's still the same challenge, just in the opposite direction.

https://www.confluent.io/blog/building-real-time-streaming-etl-pipeline-20-minutes/[Streaming ETL is nothing new for Kafka] -- it is one of the platform's core use cases.   A big complicating factor for Neo4j-streams is that not many people have done it for graph before neo4j-streams.
