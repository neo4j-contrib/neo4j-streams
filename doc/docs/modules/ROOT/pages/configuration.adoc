[#neo4j_configuration_system]
== Configuration system overview

=== Location of Configuration Information

For versions prior to `4.0.7` the configuration management works statically
with the properties provided inside the `neo4j.conf` file; since the version `4.0.7`
we introduced a new configuration systems based on dynamic reloading that relies
on the `streams.conf` file inside `$NEO4J_HOME/conf`.

=== Breaking Changes

We deprecated the `neo4j.conf` file based configuration, so you need to define
a new `streams.conf` file inside `$NEO4J_HOME/conf` and put in there all the
required configuration.

==== Note about usage with Docker

The official Neo4j Docker image uses a particular naming convention for environment
variables in order to transform them into properties inside the `neo4j.conf` file.
In order to be compliant with that behaviour you can still use them without changing anything
in your configuration, under-the-hood from version `4.0.7` system
will save them inside the `streams.conf` file instead.

=== How it behaves

You can interact with the new configuration system in two ways:

* By changing the `streams.conf` manually
* By applying new configurations via procedures

*You must consider that every change applied to the configuration causes
the reload of the plugins so you must use this feature very carefully.*

=== File based changes

Every change inside the `streams.conf` is gathered and reloads the Streams `Sink`
and `Source` with the new configuration.

=== Procedure based changes

From version `4.0.7` you'll find three new procedures:

* `streams.configuration.get` returns the current configuration
* `streams.configuration.set({<plugin_config_map>}, {<procedure_config>})` that applies
the new configuration and returns it
* `streams.configuration.remove({<plugin_config_keys_list>}, {<procedure_config>})` that removes
the provided configuration keys and returns the new configuration status

*N.B.* These procedures work for each database instance this means that if you're changing a property that affected
all databases that are running a Streams module will be notified and restarted.

==== `streams.configuration.get`

This procedure returns the current configuration applied to both `Sink` and `Source`
plugin.

Output Parameters:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`name`
|The configuration name

|`value`
|The configuration value

|===

So given the following procedure call:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL streams.configuration.get() YIELD name, value
RETURN name, value
----

You'll have this following output (it's related to *your* configuration ðŸ˜„)

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|name
|value

|"streams.sink.topic.cypher.test"
|"CREATE (p:Person{name: event.name, surname: event.surname})"

|"streams.sink.errors.tolerance"
|"all"

|"kafka.default.api.timeout.ms"
|"5000"

|"kafka.bootstrap.servers"
|"broker:9093"

|"streams.sink.errors.log.include.messages"
|"true"

|"streams.sink.enabled"
|"true"

|"streams.sink.errors.log.enable"
|"true"

|===

==== `streams.configuration.set`

This procedure applies the map of configuration parameters passed as first argument.

Input Parameters:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`plugin_config_map`
|This map represents the set of configurations applied to the `Sink` and the `Source`

|`procedure_config`
|The configuration map

|===

Output Parameters:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`name`
|The configuration name

|`value`
|The configuration value

|===

Following the accepted parameters for the `procedure_config`:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|Configuration Name
|Description

|`save`
|(Boolean, default `true`) if persist or not the configuration
into the file in order to have it back once the database is restarted
for whatever reason

|===

So given the following procedure call:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL streams.configuration.set({`streams.sink.topic.cypher.test`: 'CREATE (p:Person{name: event.name, surname: event.surname, fullName: event.name + ' ' + event.surname})'}, {save: false}) YIELD name, value
RETURN name, value
----

You'll have this following output (it's related to *your* configuration ðŸ˜„)

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|name
|value

|"streams.sink.topic.cypher.test"
|"CREATE (p:Person{name: event.name, surname: event.surname})"

|"streams.sink.errors.tolerance"
|"all"

|"kafka.default.api.timeout.ms"
|"5000"

|"kafka.bootstrap.servers"
|"broker:9093"

|"streams.sink.errors.log.include.messages"
|"true"

|"streams.sink.enabled"
|"true"

|"streams.sink.errors.log.enable"
|"true"

|===

==== `streams.configuration.remove`

This procedure removes the provided list of keys from the configuration.

Input Parameters:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`plugin_config_keys_list`
|This list represents the properties set that will be removed from the configuration.

|`procedure_config`
|The configuration map

|===

Output Parameters:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`name`
|The configuration name

|`value`
|The configuration value

|===

Following the accepted parameters for the `procedure_config`:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|Configuration Name
|Description

|`save`
|(Boolean, default `true`) if persist or not the configuration
into the file in order to have it back once the database is restarted
for whatever reason

|===

So given the following procedure call:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL streams.configuration.remove([`kafka.acks`], {save: false}) YIELD name, value
RETURN name, value
----

You'll have this following output (it's related to *your* configuration ðŸ˜„)

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|name
|value

|"streams.sink.topic.cypher.test"
|"CREATE (p:Person{name: event.name, surname: event.surname})"

|"streams.sink.errors.tolerance"
|"all"

|"kafka.default.api.timeout.ms"
|"5000"

|"kafka.bootstrap.servers"
|"broker:9093"

|"streams.sink.errors.log.include.messages"
|"true"

|"streams.sink.enabled"
|"true"

|"streams.sink.errors.log.enable"
|"true"

===== What happens when we change a configuration properties from procedure

When we change the configuration properties from `streams.configuration.set/remove`,
under-the-hood `Sink` and `Source` modules are reloaded. So use it carefully
because it has an impact in your Stream flow.

*N.b.* The Source/Sink module will be restarted only if there are changes in the
configuration related to itself; this means that if you have both active and
you change properties related to the Sink, only it will be restarted.

*What happens into the `Source` module*

During the reload process the transaction event handler gets unplugged, this
means that all transaction that even happen during reload period are not
caught by the `Source`, so they are *lost*.

*What happens into the `Sink` module*

During the reload process the Sink gets stopped, this should not have
any impact in your ingestion process because it will restart from the last
committed messages, so there is no data loss.
