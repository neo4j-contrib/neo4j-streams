== Serializers

To allow insertion of keys in any format (e.g. through `streams.publish` procedure)
**the `key.serializer` is set with the `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.ByteArraySerializer`**
like `value.serializer`

== Transaction Event Handler

The transaction event handler is the core of the Stream Producer and allows to stream database changes.

=== Events

The Producer streams three kind of events:

* *created*: when a node/relation/property is created
* *updated*: when a node/relation/property is updated
* *deleted*: when a node/relation/property is deleted

==== Created

Following an example of the node creation event:

[source,json]
----
include::ROOT:partial$producer-data/node.created.json[]
----

[source,json]
----
include::ROOT:partial$producer-data/relationship.created.json[]
----

==== Updated

Following an example of the node update event:

[source,json]
----
include::ROOT:partial$producer-data/node.updated.json[]
----

[source,json]
----
include::ROOT:partial$producer-data/relationship.updated.json[]
----

==== Deleted

Following an example of the node creation event:

[source,json]
----
include::ROOT:partial$producer-data/node.deleted.json[]
----

[source,json]
----
include::ROOT:partial$producer-data/relationship.deleted.json[]
----

=== Meta

The *meta* field contains the metadata related to the transaction event:

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*timestamp*
|Number
|The timestamp related to the transaction event

|*username*
|String
|The username that generated the transaction

|*tx_id*
|Number
|The transaction id provided by the Neo4j trasaction manager

|*tx_event_count*
|Number
|The number of the events included into the transaction (i.e. 2 update on nodes, 1 relationship creation)

|*tx_event_id*
|Number
|The id of the event inside the transaction

|*operation*
|enum["created", "updated", "deleted"]
|The operation type

|*source*
|Object
|Contains the information about the source
|===

==== Source

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*hostname*
|String
|The information about the source
|===

=== Payload

The *payload* field contains the information about the the data related to the event

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*id*
|Number
|The id of the graph entity

|*type*
|enum["node", "relationship"]
|The type of the graph entity

|*before*
|Object
|The data before the transaction event

|*after*
|Object
|The data after the transaction event
|===

=== Payload: before and after

We must distinguish two cases:

==== Nodes

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*labels*
|String[]
|List of labels attached to the node

|*properties*
|Map<K, V>
|List of properties attached to the node, the `K` is the property name
|===

==== Relationships

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*label*
|string
|The relationship type

|*properties*
|Map<K,V>
|List of properties attached to the relationship, the `K` is the property name

|*start*
|Object
|The starting node of the relationship

|*end*
|Object
|The ending node of the relationship
|===

==== Relationships: startNode and endNode

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*id*
|Number
|The id of the node

|*labels*
|String[]
|List of labels attached to the node

|*ids*
|Map<K,V>
|The ids related to the defined constraints for the node (`UNIQUENESS` and/or `NODE_KEY`). The `K` is the property name, and the `V` the related value

|===

=== Schema

[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*constraints*
|Object[]
|List of constraints attached to the entity

|*properties*
|Map<K, V>
|List of properties attached to the entity, where the `K` is the property name and the `V` is the class type
|===

=== Constraints

Nodes and Relationships can have a list of constraints attached to them:

.Constraints
[cols="3*",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Type
|Description

|*label*
|String
|The label attached to the constraint

|*type*
|enum["UNIQUE", "NODE_PROPERTY_EXISTS", "RELATIONSHIP_PROPERTY_EXISTS"]
|The constraint type

|*properties*
|String[]
|List of properties involved in the constraint
