= When to use Kafka Connect Neo4j Connector vs. Neo4j Streams as a Plugin

[abstract]
This section covers how to decide whether to run as a Kafka Connect worker, or as a Neo4j Plugin.

== Kafka Connect

=== Pros

* Processing is outside of Neo4j so that memory & CPU impact doesn't impact Neo4j.
You don't need to size the database with Kafka utilization in mind.
* Much easier for Kafka pros to manage; they benefit from the Confluent ecosystem,
such as connecting the REST API to manipulate connectors, the control center to administer & monitor them.
* By restarting the worker, you can restart your sink/source strategy without having downtime for Neo4j.
* Upgrade Neo4j-Streams without restarting the cluster
* Strictly an external bolt client, so better overall security management of plugin actions.

=== Cons

* If you're using Confluent Cloud, you can't host the connector in the cloud (yet).
So this requires a 3rd piece of architecture:  Confluent Cloud, Neo4j, and the Connect Worker (usually a separate VM)
* Possibly worse throughput due to bolt latency & overhead, and separate network hop.

== Neo4j-Streams Plugin

=== Pros

* Much easier for Neo4j pros to manage
* You can produce records back out to Kafka
* You can use Neo4j procedures so that "custom produce" (see later section) becomes an option.
* Possibly better throughput, because you don't have bolt latency / overhead

=== Cons

* Memory & CPU consumption on your Neo4j Server
* Need to track config to be identical across all members in the cluster
* Lesser ability to manage the plugin because it is running inside of the database and not under a particular user account.
