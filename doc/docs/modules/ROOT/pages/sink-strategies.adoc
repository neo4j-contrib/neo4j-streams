=== Sink ingestion strategies

==== Change Data Capture Event


_This paragraph has as pre-requisite a Neo4j 4.x instance running with the Streams plugin 4.1.x.
For Neo4j 5.x the database plugin is no longer available._

This method allows to ingest CDC events coming from another Neo4j Instance. You can use two strategies:

* The `SourceId` strategy which merges the nodes/relationships by the CDC event `id` field (it's related to the Neo4j physical ID)
* The `Schema` strategy which merges the nodes/relationships by the constraints (UNIQUENESS, NODE_KEY) defined in your graph model

===== The `SourceId` strategy

You can configure the topic in the following way:

[source,ini,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{environment}.topic.cdc.sourceId=<list of topics separated by semicolon>
{environment}.topic.cdc.sourceId.labelName=<the label attached to the node, default=SourceEvent>
{environment}.topic.cdc.sourceId.idName=<the id name given to the CDC id field, default=sourceId>
----

[source,ini,subs="attributes"]
----
{environment}.topic.cdc.sourceId=my-topic;my-other.topic
----

Each streams event will be projected into the related graph entity, for instance the following event:

[source,json]
----
include::ROOT:partial$producer-data/node.created.json[]
----

will be persisted as the following node:

[source,cypher]
----
Person:SourceEvent{first_name: "Anne Marie", last_name: "Kretchmar", email: "annek@noanswer.org", sourceId: "1004"}
----

as you can notice, ingested event has been projected with two peculiarities:

* the `id` field has transformed into `sourceId`;
* the node has an additional label `SourceEvent`;

these two fields will be used in order to match the node/relationship for future updates/deletes

===== The `Schema` strategy

You can configure the topic in the following way:

[source,ini,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{environment}.topic.cdc.schema=<LIST_OF_TOPICS_SEPARATED_BY_SEMICOLON>
----

[source,ini,subs="attributes"]
----
{environment}.topic.cdc.schema=my-topic;my-other.topic
----

Each streams event will be projected into the related graph entity, for instance the following event:

[source,json]
----
include::ROOT:partial$producer-data/node.created.json[]
----

will be persisted as the following node:

[source,cypher]
----
Person{first_name: "Anne Marie", last_name: "Kretchmar", email: "annek@noanswer.org"}
----

The `Schema` strategy leverages the `schema` field in order to insert/update the nodes so no extra fields will be created.

In case of relationship

[source,json]
----
include::ROOT:partial$producer-data/relationship.created.json[]
----

the `Schema` strategy leverages the `ids` fields in order to insert/update the relationships so no extra fields will be created.

==== The `Pattern` strategy

The `Pattern` strategy allows you to extract nodes and relationships from a json by providing a extraction pattern

Each property can be prefixed with:

* `!`: identify the id (could be more than one property), it's *mandatory*
* `-`: exclude the property from the extraction
If no prefix is specified this means that the property will be included

[NOTE]
**You cannot mix inclusion and exclusion so your pattern must contains all exclusion
or inclusion properties**

Labels can be chained via `:`

.Tombstone Record Management
The pattern strategy come out with the support to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(data_store)[Tombstone Record],
in order to leverage it your event should contain as key the record that you want to delete and `null` for the value.

[NOTE]
**Currently you can't concatenate multiple patterns (for example in case you use just one topic and produce more then one node/relationship type).
So you have to use a different topic for each type of node/relationship and define a pattern for each of them**

===== The `Node Pattern` configuration

You can configure the node pattern extraction in the following way:

[source,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{environment}.topic.pattern.node.<TOPIC_NAME>=<NODE_EXTRACTION_PATTERN>
----

So for instance, given the following `json` published via the `user` topic:

[source,json]
----
{"userId": 1, "name": "Andrea", "surname": "Santurbano", "address": {"city": "Venice", "cap": "30100"}}
----

You can transform it into a node by providing the following configuration:


by specifying a simpler pattern:

[source,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{environment}.topic.pattern.node.user=User{!userId}
----

or by specifying a Cypher like node pattern:

[source,subs="attributes"]
----
{environment}.topic.pattern.node.user=(:User{!userId})
----

Similar to the CDC pattern you can provide:

[cols="1m,3a",opts=header]
|===
| pattern
| meaning

| User:Actor{!userId} or User:Actor{!userId,*}
| the userId will be used as ID field and all properties of the json will be attached to the node with the provided
labels (`User` and `Actor`) so the persisted node will be: *(User:Actor{userId: 1, name: 'Andrea', surname: 'Santurbano', `address.city`: 'Venice', `address.cap`: 30100})*

| User{!userId, surname}
| the userId will be used as ID field and *only* the surname property of the json will be attached to the node with the provided
labels (`User`) so the persisted node will be: *(User{userId: 1, surname: 'Santurbano'})*

| User{!userId, surname, address.city}
| the userId will be used as ID field and *only* the surname and the `address.city` property of the json will be attached to the node with the provided
labels (`User`) so the persisted node will be: *(User{userId: 1, surname: 'Santurbano', `address.city`: 'Venice'})*

| User{!userId,-address}
| the userId will be used as ID field and the `address` property will be excluded
so the persisted node will be: *(User{userId: 1, name: 'Andrea', surname: 'Santurbano'})*

|===

===== The `Relationship Pattern` configuration

You can configure the relationship pattern extraction in the following way:

[source,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{environment}.topic.pattern.relationship.<TOPIC_NAME>=<RELATIONSHIP_EXTRACTION_PATTERN>
----

So for instance, given the following `json` published via the `user` topic:

[source,json]
----
{"userId": 1, "productId": 100, "price": 10, "currency": "€", "shippingAddress": {"city": "Venice", cap: "30100"}}
----

You can transform it into a path, like `(n)-[r]->(m)`, by providing the following configuration:

By specifying a simpler pattern:

[source,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{environment}.topic.pattern.relationship.user=User{!userId} BOUGHT{price, currency} Product{!productId}
----

or by specifying a Cypher like node pattern:

[source,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{environment}.topic.pattern.relationship.user=(:User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{price, currency}]->(:Product{!productId})
----

in this last case the we assume that `User` is the source node and `Product` the target node


Similar to the CDC pattern you can provide:

[cols="1m,3a",opts=header]
|===
| pattern
| meaning

| (User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT]->(Product{!productId}) or (User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{price, currency}]->(Product{!productId})
| this will merge fetch/create the two nodes by the provided identifier and the `BOUGHT` relationship between them. And then set all the other json properties on them so the persisted data will be:
*(User{userId: 1})-[:BOUGHT{price: 10, currency: '€', `shippingAddress.city`: 'Venice', `shippingAddress.cap`: 30100}]->(Product{productId: 100})*

| (User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT\{price\}]->(Product{!productId})
| this will merge fetch/create the two nodes by the provided identifier and the `BOUGHT` relationship between them. And then set all the specified json properties so the persisted pattern will be:
*(User{userId: 1})-[:BOUGHT{price: 10}]->(Product{productId: 100})*

| (User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{-shippingAddress}]->(Product{!productId})
| this will merge fetch/create the two nodes by the provided identifier and the `BOUGHT` relationship between them. And then set all the specified json properties (by the exclusion) so the persisted pattern will be:
*(User{userId: 1})-[:BOUGHT{price: 10, currency: '€'}]->(Product{productId: 100})*

| (User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{price,currency, shippingAddress.city}]->(Product{!productId})
| this will merge fetch/create the two nodes by the provided identifier and the `BOUGHT` relationship between them. And then set all the specified json properties so the persisted pattern will be:
*(User{userId: 1})-[:BOUGHT{price: 10, currency: '€', `shippingAddress.city`: 'Venice'}]->(Product{productId: 100})*

|===

===== Attach properties to node

By default no properties will be attached to the edge nodes but you can specify which property attach to each node. Given the following `json` published via the `user` topic:

[source,json]
----
{
    "userId": 1,
    "userName": "Andrea",
    "userSurname": "Santurbano",
    "productId": 100,
    "productName": "My Awesome Product!",
    "price": 10,
    "currency": "€"
}
----

[cols="1m,3a",opts=header]
|===
| pattern
| meaning

| (User{!userId, userName, userSurname})-[:BOUGHT]->(Product{!productId, productName})
| this will merge two nodes and the `BOUGHT` relationship between with all json properties them so the persisted pattern will be:
*(User{userId: 1, userName: 'Andrea', userSurname: 'Santurbano'})-[:BOUGHT{price: 10, currency: '€'}]->(Product{productId: 100, name: 'My Awesome Product!'})*
