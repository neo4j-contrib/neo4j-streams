This project integrates Neo4j with streaming data solutions.

Currently it provides an integration with *Apache Kafka and the Confluent Platform*.

The project contains these components:

== Neo4j Kafka Connect Neo4j Connector

A https://www.confluent.io/connector/kafka-connect-neo4j-sink/[Kafka Connect Sink plugin] that allows to ingest events from Kafka to Neo4j via templated Cypher statements. (link:{docs}#_kafka_connect_sink_plugin[docs], https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-connect-neo4j-sink-plugin[article])
