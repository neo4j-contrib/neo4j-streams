This project integrates Neo4j with streaming data solutions.

Currently it provides an integration with *Apache Kafka and the Confluent Platform*.

The project contains these components:

== Neo4j Kafka Connect Neo4j Connector

A https://www.confluent.io/connector/kafka-connect-neo4j-sink/[Kafka Connect Sink plugin] that allows to ingest events from Kafka to Neo4j via templated Cypher statements. (link:{docs}#_kafka_connect_sink_plugin[docs], https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-connect-neo4j-sink-plugin[article])

== Neo4j Server Extension

* Source: a Change-Data-Capture (CDC) implementation sends change data to Kafka topics (link:{docs}#_neo4j_streams_source[docs])
* Sink: a Neo4j extension that ingest data from Kafka topics into Neo4j via templated Cypher statements (link:{docs}#_neo4j_streams_sink[docs])
* Neo4j Streams Procedures (Read & Write): Procedures to write to and read from topics interactively/programmatically (link:{docs}#_procedures[docs])

== Installation Server Extension

You can run/test the extension link:{docs}#docker[locally with Docker], or install it manually into your existing Neo4j server.

1. Download the jar-file from the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-streams/releases/latest[latest release]
2. Copy `neo4j-streams-<VERSION>.jar` into `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins`
3. Update `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` with the necessary configuration.
4. Restart Neo4j
